  ## Description
  
  This app generates README.md files based on input from the user in the command line. README files are critical
  tools for developers, allowing them to describe their app or project via an organized, succinct and easy-to-access text
  file. However, they can be a pain to create sometimes, especially when your primary focus is towards the project itself. Use this README generator to quickly generate a markdown file based on inputs that you supply through the command line on VS code. It will format all of your responses neatly into a professional-looking README file, removing the hassle from your workflow and allowing you to focus more on the important things.

  ## Installation
  
  To install this app, clone the repository from (https://github.com/shnala/readme-generator-bcs) and then run NPM install on the index.js file. This will download the modules necessary for the app to function. Currently, this app only uses the inquirer module.

  ## Usage
  
  To use this app, open index.js from the cloned repo. Open the integrated terminal on index.js and then enter "node ./index.js" on the command line and a series of prompts will appear. Type in your response to each prompt and hit enter. Once you've gone through all the prompts, a README file based on your answers will appear in the same folder.
