  ## Installation
  
  To run this app, clone the repository and then run NPM install on the index.js file. This will download the modules necessary for the app to function. Currently, this app only uses the inquirer module.
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use this app, open index.js from the repository that you cloned and then open the integrated terminal. Run Node on index.js and a series of prompts will appear in the command line. Type in your response to each prompt and hit enter. Once you've gone through all the prompts, a README file based on your answers will appear in the same folder.
